Using Jupyter Notebook, I analyzed the NBA dataset to predict the top championship contenders. 
By exploring the team's statistics, I selected key features for prediction through an extensive feature selection process. 
I then explored various machine learning algorithms and optimized their parameters, I fine-tuned each model to maximize predictive accuracy. 
Through iterative testing and refinement, I have concluded the most effective model for predicting The Top 8 NBA championship teams for the NBA 2023 Season.
