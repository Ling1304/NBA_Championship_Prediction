# Predicting NBA Championship Contenders: A Machine Learning Approach

This project leverages advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the top 8 NBA championship contenders for the 2023 season. Using the NBA dataset, the analysis focuses on extracting meaningful insights from team statistics, identifying key performance indicators through a rigorous feature selection process.

The workflow includes:

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing: 
Cleaned and prepared the NBA dataset, ensuring data quality and consistency for accurate predictions.

## Feature Selection: 
Conducted an in-depth feature selection process to identify the most relevant attributes influencing team performance.

## Model Selection and Optimization:
Explored various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Stacked Regression) and tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Iterative Refinement: 
Applied iterative testing to enhance the predictive accuracy of models, using scoring metrics like r-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE).

## Final Prediction:
Identified the most effective model and used it to predict the top 8 championship contenders for the NBA 2023 season.

This repository includes the Jupyter Notebook with detailed code and visualizations, enabling reproducibility and insights into the decision-making process behind the predictions. The project serves as a practical demonstration of data-driven decision-making in sports analytics and can be extended to other leagues or seasons.
